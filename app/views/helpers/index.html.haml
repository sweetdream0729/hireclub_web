          Speaking with my coach gave me clarity through this ambiguous job search process. Having an experienced mentor to talk through current challenges and bounce questions gave me confidence and clarity going forward. I could not be happier where I ended up.

          My session with Ketan was very helpful. He has remarkable insight on the job market and listens carefully then implements a plan of action. He offers great solutions and offers gems of wisdom. I'm very proud to refer my friends to Ketan as I know he'll take good care of them with proper guidance.
